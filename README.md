# Enterprise Application Development Project
My Enterprise Application Development Project is based on my final year project https://github.com/SeanMcSweeney/LifeSaverVR- (access can be granted at request). LifeSaverVR is a mixed reality application which uses virtual reality and real life props to teach basic lifesaving techniques such as cpr. In this project the web application allows for users to create accounts, profiles and read more about the project.
 
###  Requirements:
- XAMPP or WAMP with Apache and MySQL enabled
- MySQL with lifesaverdb.sql imported (found in extras)
- Node.js installed

#### Server started inside lifesaverreactbackend folder using npm start
